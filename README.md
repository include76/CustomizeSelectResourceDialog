# Customize Select Resource Dialog in Windows Forms

Some times you have a lot of images in the resources and when trying to choose one for image of your control, it's hard to find the one which you want, because of having a lot of image in resources.

Here in this example, I've created a custom control and for its `BackgroundImage` property, I've modified the Resource select dialog to show a filter text box which you can use to searh between items of the list box.
